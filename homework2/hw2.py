# 1) Suppose your current working directory is ~/Desktop/classes/python_decal/. What command would allow you to navigate directly to ~/Desktop?
# cd ../../
# 2) What does ~/ mean?
# the tilde-slash means “home directory”
# 3) What's the difference between and abolute and a relative path in your terminal?
# An absolute path is a complete path to a file or directory from root directory. Relative path is a path toa file or directory that is relative to the current directory and specifies location of a file/directory to the current one. 
# 4) What command would bring you back to your home directory?
# cd ~/
# 5) If you called rm ./ in your current working directory, what would it do? 
# It would attempt to delete/remove all files and directories directly within your current directory
# 6) In your current working directory, what does calling "git add" do? What about "git commit"? What about "git push"?
# "git add" adds code to the git staging area ie when updating files or changes. "Git commit" commits changes to local repository and saves them with a message. "Git push" uploads code to remote github repository
# 7) Let's say you call "git add" in your current working directory and then "git status". What message would appear? What is it telling you?
# The message that appears is: modified:  homework2/hw2.py. It is telling me that hw2.py has some changes and is modified. 
# 8) What has been the most frustrating error or bug you've encountered in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot and resolve it?
# I was running into an error when attempting to copy the "homework2" directory from brianna_repo into tushita_decal using the cp command and it was very annoying because it kept moving different folders into other folders. I resolved it by simply copying and pasting the homework2 folder into mine through File Explorer. 
# 9) How does cloning a repository differ from pulling from a repository?
# Cloning a repository means to create a copy of someone else's repo from GitHub to your computer as a local copy. Pulling from a repository means to update the local copy on your computer with new commits from remote repository; it is used a lot when collaborating with others. 
# 10) Tell me a fun fact!
# Hippos are widely considered to be one of the most dangerous large animals in Africa because they attack humans and crocodiles with no apparent provocation.
